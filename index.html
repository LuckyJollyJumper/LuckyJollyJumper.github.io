                <h1>HEXED</h1>
                <p>
                    Physical 2-6 player boardgame having the setting of witches and mages competing to become the single ruler of the world. In this world 3 types of magic exits: 
                    <ol>
                        Creation, augmentation and Destruction
                    </ol> 
                    Players need to explore hexagons and gather resources in a hexagonal world by building structures or using the types of magic to 
                    gain the most victory points. The positioning and rotation of structures is vital for success and can also be sabotaged by others. Each player gets personalised missions that shape the strategy but, beware of the monsters that 
                    lurk in the forests and move around with each round.

                    Every magic type has a different playstyle
                    <ol>
                        <li>Augmentation is about rotation of hexagons and buildings to get the most out of the synergy of buildings.</li>
                        <li>Destruction is about exploration and sabotage by completely destroying hexagons</li>
                        <li>Creation is about gathering of resources and making other buildings stronger</li>
                    </ol>
