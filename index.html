                    Physcial 2-6 player boardgame having the setting of witches and mages wanting to be the best of the land. In this land 3 types of magic exits: Creation, Augmentation and Destruction. Players need to explore hexagons and gather resources in a hexagonal world by building structures or using the types of magic to 
                    gain the most victory points. The positioning and rotation of structures is vital for success and can also be sabotaged by others. Each player gets personalised missions that shape the strategy but, beware of the monsters that 
                    lurk in the forests and move around with each step.
